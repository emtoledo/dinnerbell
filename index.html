    <section class="about">
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>
        In 1926, a group of chefs and musicians in Atlanta gathered in the tower of the Sears & Roebuck building to put on a radio broadcast called Dinner Bell; it lasted only two years.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of reviving this great collaboration, Quiet Hounds will be teaming up with friends at <a href="">Venkman's</a> - Executive Chef Nick Melvin and Nick Niespodziani - as well as <a href="">IndieATL</a> to bring Dinner Bell back to life. Be among the first to take in Dinner Bell - a curated culinary and musical journey building upon the traditional underground supper club. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On June 5th 2016, we will gather at Venkman's in the Old 4th Ward where featured executive chef Daniel Chance of famed Star Provisions and Dub's at PCM will be serving up a delectable, family style dinner while music will be provided by <a href="">Quiet Hounds</a> featuring musical guest, producer and multi-instrumentalist, Ben Holst. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Seating is limited. $85 Ticket includes live music, dinner and gratuity (alcohol not included). Menu will be revealed a week before the event and will accommodate vegetarian and gluten free options if required. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This event is pre-sale only. No tickets available at the door. Dress is casual. The event will begin promptly at 7pm, please be on time.
