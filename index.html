              <h2>
                Adam Evans
              </h2>
              <p>
                Growing up in Alabama, Adam Evans spent his childhood days fishing in local lakes and rivers with his family. His hometown was an epicenter for rock and roll and blues. "I'm from Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Everybody recorded there," he says. "Bob Dylan, Etta James, the Rolling Stones."
              </p>
              <p>
                Evans holds those influences near and dear as his culinary career has given way to numerous awards and recognitions. In spring 2011, Evans took over The Optimist as executive chef, where he spearheaded the restaurant’s sustainable seafood drive exhibiting his deep relationship with the Gulf Coast. His work has been lauded by Esquire, Food &amp; Wine, Travel + Leisure, Condé Nast Traveler, Southern Living, Atlanta Magazine and the Atlanta Journal Constitution, as well as named one of the top restaurants in Atlanta several times by The Atlantan. Adam was also nominated for Food & Wine’s People’s Best New Chef in 2015.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today Evans is on board as chef-partner at celebrity chef Jonathan Waxman's Ponce City Market venture, Brezza Cucina.

                The Secret Sisters
              </h2>
              <p>
                Growing up surrounded by the sounds of the South and the powerful timeless music emanating from Muscle Shoals, The Secret Sisters were heavily influenced by a range of uniquely American musical styles, including country, bluegrass and gospel, as well as classic rock and pop.  They were raised on a rich tapestry of music, listening to everything from George Jones and Loretta Lynn, to The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, The Ramones, Fiona Apple and Rufus Wainwright.  </p>
              <p>
                  But it was their father, a musician himself, who introduced Laura and Lydia to bluegrass at an early age and spent many weekends bringing his daughters to local bluegrass festivals.  The result is Put Your Needle Down, an eclectic mix of musical styles and sounds rooted in storytelling that showcases their depth and growth as songwriters, vocalists and as women.

      <p>
        In 1926, a group of chefs and musicians in Atlanta gathered in the tower of the Sears & Roebuck building to put on a radio broadcast called Dinner Bell; it lasted only two years.
