                Anne Quatrano is widely held to be one of the country’s greatest chefs. Her meticulous attention to detail dovetails seamlessly with her devotion to freshness, flavor and simplicity. Anne has – since her earliest days – prided herself in using locally grown seasonal and organic produce, much of which is from her own organic gardens. Together with her husband, award-winning chef Clifford Harrison, she operates four of Atlanta, GA’s most celebrated restaurants – Bacchanalia, Floataway Café and Little Bacch as well as a cook’s market, Star Provisions.

                One of Bitter Southerner’s best southern albums of 2016 and heard on NPR’s All Things Considered, Nashville singer/songwriter Becky Warren weaves a compelling musical narrative rooted in her own life experiences and the rich sounds of Americana and rock &amp; roll. Becky joins us while touring widely in support of her latest release, War Surplus including full-band stints with the Indigo Girls.

      <p>
        In 1926, a group of chefs and musicians in Atlanta gathered in the tower of the Sears &amp; Roebuck building in Atlanta, GA to put on a radio broadcast called Dinner Bell; it lasted only two years.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of reviving this great collaboration, we invite you to join us on September 24th at Empire State South for a very special Dinner Bell experience. Acclaimed Chefs Hugh Acheson &amp; Josh Hopkins will be preparing a unique, 5 course meal that will surely stun the senses. Dinner Bell is also honored to be joined by legendary songwriter and frontman of Drivn N Cryin, Kevn Kinney.
