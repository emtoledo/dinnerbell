                Zeb Stevenson, a former Cornell art major, has risen through the ranks to make a culinary name for himself in Atlanta. Zeb advanced his career taking on the position of executive sous chef and opening Spice Market while training under Jean-Georges Vongerichten, one of the world’s best and most famous chefs. Later, Zeb made a move to The Livingston as chef de cuisine collaborating with chef Gary Mennie and he was quickly promoted to executive chef. During his tenure at The Livingston, he won Food Network’s “Chopped” cooking competition and opened Proof + Provision speakeasy, which became an immediate success. Zeb has evolved into a forward thinking chef and his commitment to local and sustainable ingredients allows him to be at his creative best.

                Growing up surrounded by the sounds of the South and the powerful timeless music emanating from Muscle Shoals, The Secret Sisters were heavily influenced by a range of uniquely American musical styles, including country, bluegrass and gospel, as well as classic rock and pop.  They were raised on a rich tapestry of music, listening to everything from George Jones and Loretta Lynn, to The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, The Ramones, Fiona Apple and Rufus Wainwright.  </p>
              <p>
                  But it was their father, a musician himself, who introduced Laura and Lydia to bluegrass at an early age and spent many weekends bringing his daughters to local bluegrass festivals.  The result is Put Your Needle Down, an eclectic mix of musical styles and sounds rooted in storytelling that showcases their depth and growth as songwriters, vocalists and as women.

      <p>
        In 1926, a group of chefs and musicians in Atlanta gathered in the tower of the Sears &amp; Roebuck building in Atlanta, GA to put on a radio broadcast called Dinner Bell; it lasted only two years.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of reviving this great collaboration, we invite you to join us on April 23rd at Watershed on Peachtree for a very special Dinner Bell experience. Quiet Hounds is honored to be joined by Atlanta, folk legends Indigo Girls. And if this musical collaboration doesn’t completely satiate your palette, acclaimed chef Zeb Stevenson will be preparing a unique, 5 course meal that will surely stun the senses.
