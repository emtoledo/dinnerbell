                An Atlanta native offering more than 20 years of culinary experience, chef Chance got his start working with the Buckhead Life Group starting at Pricci and then achieving his first Sous chef position at the former Veni Vidi Vici. Chef Chance has grown to master his craft and pallet finally finding a home with Anne Quatrano and Clifford Harris at the acclaimed Bacchanalia in West midtown Atlanta. Additionally, chef Chance's work with seasonal commercial fishing in Kodiak Alaska has given him a better understanding of how fresh seafood is made available across the country.

                Chef Chance now helms the kitchen as Executive chef for Anne Quatrano at W.H. Stiles fish camp at Ponce city market in the refurbished Sears and Roebucks building. The restaurant is named after Anne's Georgia family lineage. At Fish Camp, chef Chance loves using seasonal and local produce as well as fresh fish and oysters from the southeast.

      <p>
        In 1926, a group of chefs and musicians in Atlanta gathered in the tower of the Sears & Roebuck building to put on a radio broadcast called Dinner Bell; it lasted only two years.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of reviving this great collaboration, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quiethounds.com">Quiet Hounds</a> will be teaming up with friends at <a target="_blank" href="http://venkmans.com/">Venkman's</a> - Executive Chef Nick Melvin and Nick Niespodziani - as well as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indieatl.com/">IndieATL</a> to bring Dinner Bell back to life. Be among the first to take in Dinner Bell - a curated culinary and musical journey building upon the traditional underground supper club.
